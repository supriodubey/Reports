I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Michele Liguori, and my co-supervisors, Dr. Andrea Ravenni and Dr. Gabriel Jung, for giving me the opportunity to work on this project. I am deeply thankful for their insightful discussions and constant support, which have significantly broadened my knowledge. I also appreciate the valuable discussions with my examiner, Professor Alessandro Renzi.


I would also like to express my heartfelt thanks to my friends Anant, Chelsea, Siddhesh, Ankita, Helena, and Mayank, who stood by me through difficult times, kept me motivated, and supported me in every way possible. Additionally, I am grateful to my flatmates and other friends who made my time in Padova an enjoyable experience. Lastly, I extend my deepest gratitude to my mother, whose unwavering support and encouragement have inspired me to pursue my dreams.
